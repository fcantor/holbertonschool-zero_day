The 0x01 Emacs project is about learning to use the GNU Emacs, a powerful and advanced editor. It includes learning commands for opening and saving files, cutting an entire line, and pasting it back, searching forward, undo, and quitting Emacs. 

The Guided Tour of Emacs also has extensive information about other very useful commands on Emacs, like opening more than one window, closing and switching specific windows, cancelling half-entered commands, etc.
