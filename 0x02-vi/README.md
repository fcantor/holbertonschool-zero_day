This project, 0x02 vi, is about learning Vi, the editor that comes with the UNIX operating system. Vi stands for (VIsual editor) and has two modes of operation: Command Mode, and Insert Mode. In Command Mode, commands are entered which causes action to be taken on the file. In Insert Mode, text entered is inserted into the file.

The project includes learning both Command & Insert mode, like how to start and exit vi, how to switch from both modes, how to insert and edit text, cutting, pasting, and undoing lines, as well as searching forward and backward.
